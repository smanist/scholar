scholar
=======

Fetchs google scholar queries and outputs info or bibtex data

scholar.py is modified a little to read in real cookie, rather than fake one.

A shell script is provided, so that you can download bibtex info in batch. Detailed usage is given in the shell script.

Before downloading, remember to get the current cookie for 'scholar.google.com', e.g. by chrome plug-in 'cookie export'.
